bug prevents absolute path names,  as 'blaze_path' starts with a null token
for absolute paths ..


need to make hardlinks and set the permisions to read only on the original
link, rather than doing a copy. -- hardlinks would cause files to be left
behind after the archive is deleted, and we would have no way to find the 
orphans ..  'marked for archival'? perhaps but what is the point if they data
remains?

need to add field for the inode, see the same inode and modification time,
then we say it is the same file

we do the hard work on the local disk, with tricks such as above, then
use the incremental insert-file commands to get the files on the mirros.

need to add fields for permission flags (acls?),  for the group and owner,

lineno is sometimes a size_t sometimes a uint, need to fix that

need to explore and perhaps modify the behavior with links

other commands needed
 list  .. # various expressions for listing files in the archive, regex on name, times, sort output on times,
 restore  node_number  target_pathname
 synch arch1 arch2 # cause both archives to have the same entries
