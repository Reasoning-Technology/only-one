  <archive>
     this holds the archived data


  <source> 
     <source> is a directory to be traversed.  During traversal 1) unique
     files that are copied into the store directory, 2) an entry denoted
     the path the file is found at is placed into a map constructed in memory.
   
     uniqueness is determined by the same() function, found in file.h

     links are to be followed, if there is a referential loop the
     program gives up, otherwise the target file is handled just as
     though it were found during scanning, while its pathname is that of
     its physical location, i.e. the value of the final link.
