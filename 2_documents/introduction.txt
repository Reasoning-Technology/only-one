What this program is.

   This is an archive for storing only one copy of each file placed in it, and to support
   fancy indexing of those files.

   This archive is to be used on a large site that has a number of parallel distributed
   evolutions of projects.


How the archive is organized

  There are no external commands for manipulating the archive, rather the archive comes
  with its own commands, and the source code for those commands built in.  So for example
  to insert a file into the archive one uses the program   <archive_name>/bin/insert ...

  An archive is a directory with a number of subdirectories including: 
   'doc' for some documentation
   'src' for the program sources
   'bin' for the complied executables
   'store' for the files, 
   'tax' for an index into the files.

  We don't expect users to be poking around inside the archive directory.  Note that
  manual modification of files in the archive could destroy it.  If something goes wrong,
  we hope that having the sources will be helpful for an experienced programmer.

  In the current application the store directory is quite large, so the cost of keeping
  the source code with the archive is relatively small.

How to build the executables

   first make a copy of the archive

   read over the files and make sure you have the necessary tools installed

   in /src directory and type 'make' providing the appropriate targets, be
   sure to run the test cases provided, and many others.  Don't be bashful about
   adding more tests into the archive
