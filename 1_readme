I wrote this utility in 2012 so as to compact files from a number of nearly identical
archive CDs then DVDs into one archive.

It served me well for some years; however, I am now writing a more sophisticated tool to
look for patterns in the archive.  My goal in modifying this code today (2019-10-04) is to
get the current archive into a datbase form where it may be manipulated and moved to the
new tool.

Notable perhaps, is that it demonstrated that a couple of variations on quoting strings in
a manner that escapes for 'quote' characters are not necessary.  (see phrase.h)
